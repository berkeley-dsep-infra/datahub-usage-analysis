    "We understand that it is helpful to have extra cells breaking down the process towards reaching your final answer. If you happen to create new cells below your answer to run code, **NEVER** add cells between a question cell and the answer cell below it. It will cause errors when we run the autograder, and it will sometimes cause a failure to generate the PDF file.\n",
